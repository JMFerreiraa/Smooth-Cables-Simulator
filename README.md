# Node and Cable Simulation

This project is a work in progress simulation of nodes and cables, where you can create nodes and connect them with cables. The nodes and cables follow the laws of physics, with nodes able to be either fixed or not, and cable connections between nodes having tension and applying forces on the nodes.

P.S. I am not a physicist neither a physics student, If you find any problem with the formulas please let me know by creating a pull request! ^^

## Installation

To use this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- Pygame
- Math

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```
pip install pygame
pip install math
```


## Usage

To use this simulation, simply run the main script. The controls for creating and connecting nodes, as well as adjusting their properties, can be accessed through the shortcuts menu after starting the script.
